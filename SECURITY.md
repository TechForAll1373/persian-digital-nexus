- No backend → No server-side vulnerabilities  
- No data collection → No user tracking  
- All sensitive operations (e.g., password generation, encryption) happen **in your browser**

## Data Handling
- Password history is stored **only in your browser’s localStorage**  
- Nothing is ever sent to any server

## Reporting Issues
